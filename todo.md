- Logic
	- pages system
		- page indicator
	- grayed out submit button
	- use JS & CSS accessing built-in validations
	- conditional IF THEN, etc.
- hidden fields
	- url parameter
- wiki via mkdocs.org
- matrix for every input
- checkbox matrix
	- better syntax for this and normal matrix
		- matrix for everything
- direct linear scale
	- different icons (stars, etc.)
	- range without specific points
- ordering question / ranking
- file upload
	- specify accept types (options)
- color
- captcha services
	- friendly captcha
	- hcaptcha
- location (OpenStreetMap)

- better file upload support
- question groups (fieldsets?)

- multi dropdown
	- normal html dropdown, each select just adds/removes it from a list shown in the input field

- FULL DOCS REWORK

- every option for inputs just gets added to the input
    - special for req/opt
    - special for max/min (num) & maxlength/minlenghth (text)
        - live

- email default to custom pattern (no just tld domains allowed)

- other for checkbox/radio select type (text/area/any input)
- restore value from other after unselecting

# BUGS

- empty line in options_compile
- make radio answer compile less repetitive code
- pre-set ids need to get some verification (duplicate, valid)
